This assignment is a great opportunity to showcase your game development skills! Hereâ€™s a step-by-step plan to tackle the prototype:

Plan of Action
1. Setup Development Environment
Choose a game engine or framework like Phaser.js or plain HTML5 Canvas with JavaScript.
Set up a basic project structure:
index.html: For the game interface.
style.css: For basic styling (if needed).
game.js: For game logic.
2. Balloon Creation and Air Pump Mechanism
Air Pump:
Add a button or an image of a pump.
Each click increases the balloon's size (scaleX and scaleY).
Stop scaling after a threshold (indicating full inflation).
Balloon Initialization:
Display a balloon graphic that grows in size when the pump is clicked.
3. Balloon Flying Logic
When the balloon reaches the maximum size:
Start moving it in random directions.
Use velocity parameters for movement.
Implement boundary detection to make the balloon bounce off screen edges.
4. Balloon Bursting Mechanism
Add a click event listener for the balloon.
On tap (or click):
Remove the balloon from the screen.
Play a burst animation or sound effect.
5. Graphics and Assets
Use the provided assets for the pump and balloon.
If extra graphics are needed, use free sources like Kenney.nl or OpenGameArt.org.
Ensure proper asset management (e.g., assets/ folder).
6. Game State Management
Maintain game states like:
Pump balloon: Await user input.
Flying: Balloon is moving.
Burst: Balloon is clicked and removed.
7. Test and Package
Test the game in different browsers for compatibility.
Add comments in the code for clarity.
Zip the project files.
Technical Requirements
Random Directions for Movement: Use Math.random() to set random velocities for the balloon.
Collision Detection: Use bounding boxes for edge detection.
Responsive Design: Ensure it works on mobile and desktop.
Submission Checklist
Game Files:
Complete game with a clear folder structure.
Ensure all assets are included.
Resume and Portfolio:
Update your resume to highlight relevant skills and experiences.
If you have a portfolio, include links to previous projects (GitHub, personal website, etc.).
Documentation:
Brief instructions in a README.md file about how to run the project.
Would you like help with specific parts of the code, such as creating the balloon, adding movement, or setting up click-to-burst functionality?
